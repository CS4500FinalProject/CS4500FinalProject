* Scene
  From my understanding each scene is a level.

  Each scene/level would have a BST that would hold all the nodes and the representions of the nodes.
  #+begin_src plantuml :file ./images/Scene.png
class Scene {
     BinarySearchTree mainTree
     Cave playerCave
     rightChild
     parentNode
  }
  
  #+end_src
